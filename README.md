# FusionDovetails
This is Fusion 360 plugin that creates "tails" part of the dovetail woodworking joint on the specified edge.

![Explanation image](Resources/Dialog%20help.png)

Plugin generates parametric sketch and bodies and creates user parameters for them. This allows not only to change those parameter afterward and get "tails" recalculated, but also allowing to specify other parameters instead of constant values when creating tails and get automatically recalculated dovetails when parameters of the board changes.
